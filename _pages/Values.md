There's more to pick-up soccer than meets the eye. Even unstructured play requires organization. 

**Chicago Neighborhood Soccer** (NBHD Soccer) is a homegrown, grassroots, nonprofit organization founded and driven by local pick-up soccer players. We celebrate Chicago's pick-up soccer players, and we give back to our local communities.
