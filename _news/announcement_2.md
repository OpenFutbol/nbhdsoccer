## Hello, Women’s Wednesday! 



### **First and foremost**, 

Thank you for coming out and kicking it with us. We are ecstatic about having you all join the Chicago Neighborhood Soccer community; this is for everyone!  Everyone makes a difference, and the entire community is better for having you join it.  


> In these past 12 months, we have grown over 1,000 new members on meetup! Almost 20% of that has been women!  Special shout out to Shelby Ponder and Nicole Hack for working with us to make this happen.


### **Second**, 


we plan on doing more for women's pickup soccer!  To do that, we need to start charging enough to cover basic facility fees.  ***We were happy to put a couple grand of our own money, and take that risk, to subsidize an opportunity for women to come out and play pickup soccer for the first two months.***  Now that two months have passed, it's clear that this **Women’s Wednesday launch has been a great success!**  

**We are excited to say Women’s Pick-up soccer is here to stay.** To do that, all we need to do is modestly increase the price by only $3. With $3 and the continued generosity of our community through donations, we keep looking for ways to host women’s pickup. So, don’t forget to donate; it’s all coming back to you through more events.


>Starting next week, February 15, 2023, it will be $8 to RSVP for Women's Wednesday.  To ensure we meet our goals, to successfully RSVP you’ll have to provide $8
